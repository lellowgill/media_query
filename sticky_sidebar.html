            Adrian Pierce Rogers (September 12, 1931 – November 15, 2005) was an American Southern Baptist pastor and conservative author. He served three terms as president of the Southern Baptist Convention (1979–1980 and 1986–1988).[1] Rogers was born in West Palm Beach, Florida. He entered Christian ministry at the age of nineteen. He graduated from Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, and New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Rogers was ordained by Northwood Baptist Church (later known as The Village Baptist Church, now operating as Family Church Village[2]) in West Palm Beach. His first job as a senior pastor was at Fellsmere Baptist Church, a small congregation in Fellsmere, Florida. He performed his first baptism in the C-54 Canal near Fellsmere. He was senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Merritt Island, Florida from 1964 to 1972. In 1972, he became the senior pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, where he remained until March 2005. During this period, the church's membership grew from 9,000 to 29,000, and the church moved into a new, megachurch facility.[1] Rogers was named pastor emeritus after his retirement in March 2005.

Rogers was instrumental in the Southern Baptist denomination's conservative resurgence that began in the late 1970s, as he was elected president of the denomination during a theological controversy within the denomination. He was the chairman of the committee which produced the revised 2000 edition of the Baptist Faith and Message. He published eighteen books and his works are featured on the internationally available radio and television program, Love Worth Finding, which is broadcast in English and Spanish.[1] Rogers was also the founder of the Adrian Rogers Pastor Training Institute for ministers, which is currently headed by his widow, two sons, and a granddaughter.[3]

In November 2005, Rogers contracted pneumonia of both lungs as a complication of colon cancer treatments, and died following a period of mechanical ventilation at the age of seventy-four.

            Southern Baptist Convention presidency
            Rogers served three times as president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest American Evangelical denomination with 16 million members. He was the first conservative elected to this post in 1979 on a platform of biblical inerrancy, and beginning under his leadership, the denomination went through a ten-year-long process of shifting to a theologically conservative stance. (See Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence.) When conservative control of all SBC seminaries and agencies was finally complete, liberal and moderate seminary professors were dismissed, or replaced by theological conservatives in response to normal attrition. All employees of SBC seminaries and denominatIonal agencies were required to affirm their adherence to the Baptist Faith and Message. The denomination has remained conservative since Rogers' tenure as president.
            
            Rogers's election as SBC president at the 1979 convention held in Houston, Texas, launched the conservative resurgence in the denomination, a movement pushed by the theologian Paige Patterson and the Houston judge Paul Pressler. In 2004, in a symposium at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, Pressler said that the real movers in the Conservative resurgence who elected Rogers and the subsequent presidents were not he and Patterson but the independent-minded laypersons who came for years to the annual conventions to be heard.[4]
            
            Ed McAteer, a prominent member of Rogers' congregation, was a figure in the Christian right who in 1979 co-founded the Moral Majority with Jerry Falwell, Howard Phillips, and others. That same year, he established the Religious Roundtable, which in 1980 was active in the successful campaign to elect Ronald W. Reagan as the U.S. President.[5]

            On politics and social issues
            Like many influential conservative pastors, Rogers participated in the advancement of a conservative political agenda in the United States. He stated that Christians have a duty to be involved in government.
            
            Familial dynamics was a recurrent issue for Rogers. He focused most closely on fathers that he labeled "drop-out dads." According to Rogers, since the Bible emphasizes the paternal role in a family, the father should be the primary source of teaching in the home. He was critical of fathers who do not fulfill this role: "We have dads today that are interested in sports, business, and sex. They've forgotten their God-given assignments to teach the Ten Commandments[3]." He went on to say that social problems, such as gun violence, are the consequences of fathers avoiding this responsibility.
            
            On the topic of pastoral endorsement of political candidates, he wrote that it is a pastor's duty to influence the political decisions of the members of the pastor's congregation. A pastor need not, however, endorse a specific candidate (and, under Internal Revenue Service regulations, a church could lose its tax-exempt status for doing so). He wrote that "[i]f [a pastor] has done his job his members will prayerfully and correctly use the standard of God's Word to select the right candidate."[4]
            
            In May 2003, Rogers, along with twenty-four other religious leaders and persons of influence, signed a letter sent from Gary Bauer's conservative organization American Values to President George W. Bush. The letter criticizes President Bush's proposed Road Map for Peace initiative as being too lax towards the Palestinians. The letter states in part, "Mr. President, it would be morally reprehensible for the United States to be 'evenhanded' between democratic Israel… and the terrorist infested Palestinian infrastructure." [5]
            
            Cecil Sherman (the Coordinator of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a group of liberal Baptists who separated from the Southern Baptist Convention)[6] writes in his autobiography that he once questioned Rogers about biblical inerrancy with reference to New Testament passages that seem to support slavery. Sherman reports that Rogers replied: "I believe slavery is a much maligned institution; if we had slavery today, we would not have this welfare mess."[7][8] Rogers later signed a revised Baptist Faith and Message declaration stating that all races are equal before the Lord.[9][10]
            
            Rogers was an adamant supporter of the anti-abortion movement, had stated that the institution of capital punishment is spiritually ordained, and (along with other Southern Baptists) supported a boycott of Disney because of the company's promotion of homosexuality.[6].
            
            As a traditional Baptist, he opposed the use of alcohol and tobacco, frequently telling stories to warn of their dangers. One particular story tells of a father who learned that his daughter had died while driving drunk, vowed revenge towards whoever had sold her the alcohol, only to discover that she had taken the bottle from his own liquor cabinet.[11]
            
            Rogers also preached against gambling. In one such message, he revealed he once witnessed to boxing champion Muhammad Ali in Paradise Island, Bahamas.[12]
            
            "You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."
            This quote appears frequently[13][14][15] on the Internet and is often attributed to Rogers with an incorrect date of 1931. In fact, the quotation is part of a longer sermon by Rogers from 1984 in a larger series titled God’s Way to Health, Wealth and Wisdom (CDA107),[16] but it also appears as a passage in Rogers' 1996 work Ten Secrets for a Successful Family stating that "by and large our young people do not know either the importance or the value of honest labor".[17]
            
            Rogers did not originate the quote at all. In fact, he did not claim to have originated it. Instead, he was citing almost verbatim anti-Soviet propaganda that had circulated in many magazines in the early 1960s.[18] The quote appeared before that in the Congressional Record of 1958, where it was appended to the record by U.S. Senator George Aiken of Vermont. Aiken had taken the words from Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who had said them in his address at the Illinois Agricultural Association's annual meeting on November 13, 1957.[19] They have also been attributed to Gerald L. K. Smith, who had written them in his magazine, The Cross and the Flag.[20] Since the quote was attributed to Rogers in 2009, it has been regularly attributed to him; however, Rogers was essentially quoting Eastland or Smith at the time.

                MEMPHIS, Tenn. (BP)–Even in the face of death, friends say, Adrian Rogers exemplified the Christian faith he spent a lifetime sharing.

                The longtime pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church in suburban Memphis and the three-time Southern Baptist Convention president died Nov. 15 at the age of 74 following a battle with pneumonia and cancer.
                
                But days earlier — before he slipped into unconsciousness — Rogers delivered a message to those gathered in his hospital room that won’t soon be forgotten. At the time, doctors were preparing to place Rogers on a ventilator, which would prevent him from speaking.
                
                Steve Gaines, Rogers’ successor at Bellevue, was in the room.
                
                
                “The last thing I heard him say was, ‘I am at perfect peace,'” Gaines, who succeeded Rogers this year, told Baptist Press.
                
                Gaines and others then left the room, but Gaines decided to go back in to see Rogers “one more time.” By then, Rogers was on the ventilator, unable to talk, surrounded by doctors and nurses.
                
                “His eyes and my eyes caught one another,” Gaines said. “He looked right at me and he gave me a thumbs up. That’s just him — he was Mr. Positive. He was an awesome guy.”
                
                Rogers died just five weeks after leading a one-day preaching conference in Naples, Fla., as part of his newly founded Pastor Training Institute. It was the first time he had led such a conference. In hindsight, it also was the last.
                
                “I can’t believe [he’s dead],” Gaines said. “It just happened so quickly…. I believed with all my heart that when he went into the hospital just a little over a week ago, that he would be coming home, that this was just sort of a temporary setback, that they would hook him up with some oxygen and he would be OK. And that’s just not what happened.”
                
                Yet in the few short weeks that Gaines was Rogers’ pastor (Rogers kept his membership at Bellevue), Rogers provided a shining example of both leadership and humility.
                
                Immediately before Gaines preached his first sermon as Bellevue pastor Sept. 11, Rogers washed Gaines’ feet on the Bellevue platform, using a basin of water and a towel as Gaines sat in the pastor’s chair. It was all Rogers’ idea.
                
                
                “At first we were going to do it in a private time, in just a simple way,” Gaines said. “He did not do that for a show or anything like that. But he and I both prayed about it, and we both felt like it would really be a wonderful thing for the church to experience.”
                
                Rogers also placed a cloth mantle on Gaines to symbolize the passing of the torch.
                
                “After the foot washing, Dr. Rogers … called my wife up and his wife up, and they laid hands on us and prayed for us,” Gaines said.
                
                Foot washing, Gaines said, “symbolizes the heart of a servant” and is modeled after Jesus’ washing of his disciples’ feet.
                
                Rogers, Gaines said, epitomized humility.
                
                “He was never impressed with himself. He never was one to brag about himself,” Gaines said. “The Bible says, ‘Let another person’s lips praise you and not your own.’ He never, ever brought attention to himself in any way. I believe that one of the reasons that God exalted him is because he humbled himself. That’s just the way he lived.
                
                “He was aware, obviously, that God had done great things through him. But he always gave Jesus the glory.”
                
                Paul Pressler, the retired judge who was a leader in the Southern Baptist Conservative Resurgence, said Rogers “was always a reluctant candidate” for SBC president.
                
                “He loved preaching more than leading the convention, which spoke to his humility,” Pressler said.
                
                Amazingly, Rogers’ first great-grandchild was born the day before he died, in a hospital across town. The family, Gaines said, had prayed that the birth would not take place the same day Rogers died.
                
                “And the Lord honored that,” he said.
                
                In addition to his great-grandchild, Rogers is survived by nine grandchildren, four children, and his wife, Joyce Rogers, whom Rogers often referred to as his “grade school sweetheart.” Bellevue Baptist church members were known to look up to the Rogers as the model Christian couple. Joyce Rogers still has a love note that her then-future husband dropped on her desk in sixth grade.
                
                They met in fourth grade and married in college.
                
                “She’s the only person he’s ever dated, and vice versa,” Gaines said. “I just talked to her. She’s doing well, but it’s hard.”
                
                Gaines’ sermon Nov. 20 will be on heaven, but not because the church’s former pastor died.
                
                “That was just the way the sermons fell,” he said. ” … I had planned this sermon series back in August, and had no idea at that time he would be … in heaven. That’s just the way the Lord arranged it.”
